## Current System 19 / 20 / 00F truth

System 19 exposes 24 callable one-story building archetypes and a stable generated-role -> entity-ID seam. System 20 owns ten area profiles and seven environment palettes with deterministic parcel-fit building selection. System 00F keeps logical source identity independent from technical stream regions and follows **materialization is one-way; activation is reversible**.

Exact-head contexts: `verify/system19-local-building`, `verify/system20-local-area`, `verify/system00f-streaming-materialization`.

## Current System 23 truth

Visual knowledge remains `UNSEEN` true black, `REMEMBERED` stale observer memory, and `VISIBLE` current live truth. Remembered environment presentation follows System 25 ambient daylight. System 26 listener-specific auditory descriptors render as yellow text without revealing terrain.

System 27 now renders current physical light **below** the Perception overlay. This preserves knowledge masking: hidden current lamps/glow cannot punch through UNSEEN/REMEMBERED. Slice C has not yet changed the live System 23 visible-cell set.

Exact-head context: `verify/system23-perception`.

## Current System 24 truth

> **Loot exists before you search for it.**

Candidate 001 provides deterministic one-way persistent loot initialization into physical System 11 containers, location-aware tables, timed search and timed TAKE/STORE through System 12. Empty/looted containers do not automatically repopulate.

Exact-head context: `verify/system24-loot`.

## Current System 25 truth

System 25 interprets authoritative WHEN ticks as scenario-local time without changing WHEN. Candidate 001 uses 5 ticks/second, starts day 0 at 08:00, and exposes smooth dawn/day/dusk/night outdoor daylight consumed by System 27.

Exact-head context: `verify/system25-world-time-light`.

## Current System 26 truth

> **Sound is physical. Hearing is an estimate.**

Candidate 001 separates exact `SoundEmission` truth from listener `HeardSoundObservation` knowledge. Weighted material-aware propagation uses current WHAT + Door State; listener hearing derives from the neutral hearing-provider seam. Localization uncertainty is deterministic and cannot flip true actor-relative front/rear/left/right signs.

First fully green executable head: `2d3dcfa6fc8646cda62a5e775beb1ac7c8d04d08`.

Exact-head context: `verify/system26-spatial-sound`.

## Current System 27 truth

> **Light is physical. Vision is observer-specific. Rendering visualizes lighting; gameplay and AI never read rendered pixels to decide what is illuminated.**

Slice A owns deterministic headless illumination from System 25 daylight, enclosure/portal light, structure/door/window optical transmission, local emitter profiles, atmospheric optics and target-light useful vision range. Candidate useful range is 2 cells at zero luminance through 12 cells at full luminance with a square-root response and protected near awareness.

Slice B now renders the same samples using a multiplicative darkness/tint map plus additive local/portal/glare/scatter glow map. Physical Lighting is z=40 below System 23 Perception z=100, so visual effects cannot reveal hidden current world truth. Warm sources, blue neon, flashlight beam/shadow contrast, fog scatter and wet reflection presentation all derive from System 27 descriptors/optics.

The live critique build currently uses a clearly labeled DEV source adapter for a player-following flashlight plus diner lamp/neon/streetlight until real equipment/power/Weather owners exist. It is not canonical power or battery truth.

Physical shadows currently use structure/door/window optical geometry. Arbitrary prop/furniture optical occlusion remains a later refinement rather than a fake presentation shadow.

Slice C remains pending and will make System 23 acquisition apply the implemented target-light range contract.

First fully green Slice B executable head: `a7a95466e70853d9abbd5de9ca1a1d5610672eaf`.

Representative Slice A backend rebuild on that runner: `4085.20 µs` average.

Exact-head context: `verify/system27-physical-lighting`.

## Current presentation

The live Web build is the Rural Crossroads critique world with canonical perception, scavenging, world time/daylight, spatial-sound yellow-word feedback and **visible System 27 physical-light presentation** integrated. Current physical lighting includes time-of-day darkness/tint, enclosure/portal differences, the DEV player-following flashlight, warm fixed lights, blue neon, glow/scatter and atmosphere wet-reflection support.

System 27 Slice C light-dependent visual acquisition remains pending; the current geometric System 23 cone has not yet been reduced by darkness.
