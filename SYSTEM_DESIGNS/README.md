## Current System 19 / 20 / 00F truth

System 19 exposes 24 callable one-story building archetypes and a stable generated-role -> entity-ID seam. System 20 owns ten area profiles and seven environment palettes with deterministic parcel-fit building selection. System 00F keeps logical source identity independent from technical stream regions and follows **materialization is one-way; activation is reversible**.

Exact-head contexts: `verify/system19-local-building`, `verify/system20-local-area`, `verify/system00f-streaming-materialization`.

## Current System 23 truth

Visual knowledge remains `UNSEEN` true black, `REMEMBERED` stale observer memory, and `VISIBLE` current live truth. Remembered environment presentation follows System 25 ambient daylight.

System 23 also presents System 26 listener-specific auditory descriptors as yellow text above any visual state. Sound cues do not reveal/explore terrain and System 23 does not own physical sound propagation/localization.

System 27 Slice A now provides the physical light-derived useful-range contract that later Slice C will consume. The current live System 23 visible-cell set is not yet illumination-gated.

Exact-head context: `verify/system23-perception`.

## Current System 24 truth

> **Loot exists before you search for it.**

Candidate 001 provides deterministic one-way persistent loot initialization into physical System 11 containers, location-aware tables, timed search and timed TAKE/STORE through System 12. Empty/looted containers do not automatically repopulate.

Exact-head context: `verify/system24-loot`.

## Current System 25 truth

System 25 interprets authoritative WHEN ticks as scenario-local time without changing WHEN. Candidate 001 uses 5 ticks/second, starts day 0 at 08:00, and exposes a smooth 05:30–07:30 dawn / 18:30–20:30 dusk outdoor daylight baseline.

Exact-head context: `verify/system25-world-time-light`.

## Current System 26 truth

> **Sound is physical. Hearing is an estimate.**

Candidate 001 separates exact `SoundEmission` truth from listener `HeardSoundObservation` knowledge. Weighted material-aware propagation uses current WHAT + Door State; listener hearing derives from the neutral hearing-provider seam, with the live survivor adapter using Survival, fatigue and sleep pressure.

Localization uncertainty is deterministic and physically constrained: true front/rear/left/right actor-relative signs cannot flip. Yellow words may appear over completely black fog without revealing terrain, and cue lifetime advances only with WHEN ticks.

First fully green executable head: `2d3dcfa6fc8646cda62a5e775beb1ac7c8d04d08`.

Exact-head context: `verify/system26-spatial-sound`.

## Current System 27 truth

> **Light is physical. Vision is observer-specific. Rendering visualizes lighting; gameplay and AI never read rendered pixels to decide what is illuminated.**

Slice A implements a deterministic headless illumination field using System 25 daylight, enclosure/sky exposure, window/open-door portal transfer, local flashlight/lamp/streetlight/neon emitter profiles, wall/door/window optical transmission and neutral weather/atmosphere inputs.

The backend exposes per-cell useful luminance plus tint/direction/glare/scatter summaries. The user-required useful-vision-range policy is target-light based: Candidate 001 ranges from 2 cells at zero light to the 12-cell geometric maximum at full light with a square-root response and protected near awareness. Standing in light does not grant vision into an unlit target cell.

First fully green Slice A executable head: `b43b9d02d206658ce8155e485a2ab72be454cc0e`.

Representative bounded rebuild benchmark on that runner: `4297.78 µs` average.

Slice B rich visual shadows/glow and Slice C live System 23 acquisition integration remain unimplemented.

Exact-head context: `verify/system27-physical-lighting`.

## Current presentation

The live Web build is the Rural Crossroads critique world with canonical perception, scavenging, world time/daylight and spatial-sound yellow-word feedback integrated. System 27 Slice A is headless backend truth; visible physical lighting/shadows/glow remain Slice B and live light-dependent System 23 range remains Slice C.
